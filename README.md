## Goals

1.  To replicate various climate-related charts from primary sources in order to satiate intellectual curiosity.
2.  To hone data/visualization skills.
3.  To become comfortable using marimo notebooks instead of Jupyter ones.

## Primary Data Sources

- USHCN (`ushcn_monthly_data.parquet`) - A file I created from the primary source found at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/ushcn or ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2.5.
- Vostok Ice Core Temperature (`vostok.1999.temp.dat`) - A file I found from [Curran Kelleher's GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/curran/beb3cdbbdf735a7d8bd2c8928280582b).
- Vostok Ice Core CO2 (`vostok.icecore.co2`) - A file I found from [Curran Kelleher's GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/curran/beb3cdbbdf735a7d8bd2c8928280582b).
- Artic Sea Ice Extent (`osisaf_nh_sie_daily.text`) - A file I found via [Tony Heller's X post](https://x.com/TonyClimate/status/1913187952613580825) revealing [the primary data source](ftp://osisaf.met.no/prod_test/ice/index/v2p2/nh/osisaf_nh_sie_daily.txt) from the EUMESAT (EUropean organisation for the Exploitation of MEteorological SATellites) OSI SAF (Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility) [web site](https://osi-saf.eumetsat.int/products/osi-420).
