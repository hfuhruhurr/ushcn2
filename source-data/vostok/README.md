## Goal

To procure a primary source of the Vostok Ice Core data in order to replicate the below chart found in [Peter Clack's X post](https://x.com/PeterDClack/status/1915475093658214404).

## Primary Source Data

The web page of [the primary source](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov) is no longer active...met with a "Service Unavailable" message from the ESS-DIVE team.

But I found a copy of the data in [Curran Kelleher's GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/curran/beb3cdbbdf735a7d8bd2c8928280582b).

## Curran's [README.md](https://gist.github.com/curran/beb3cdbbdf735a7d8bd2c8928280582b#file-readme-md), as of 4/27/2025:
These datasets were downloaded from:

 * `vostok.icecore.co2` from [CDIAC: Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/co2/vostok.html)
 * `vostok.1999.temp.dat` from [CDIAC: Historical Isotopic Temperature Record from the Vostok Ice Core](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/temp/vostok/jouz_tem.htm)
 
These sources were discovered from [Skeptical Science: CO2 lags temperature - what does it mean?](https://skepticalscience.com/co2-lags-temperature-intermediate.htm).
