### Primary Data Source

ftp://osisaf.met.no/prod_test/ice/index/v2p2/nh/osisaf_nh_sie_daily.txt

- "nh" = Northern Hemisphere
- "sh" = Southern Hemisphere
- "sie" = Sea Ice Extent (the more prevelantly used stat)
- "sia" = Sea Ice Area

### Helpful

The explanations of the ftp folder structure can be gleaned from OSISAF's [Sea Ice Index page](https://osisaf-hl.met.no/v2p2-sea-ice-index) in the "Data" section.

That same page also provides the data source url, data definitions, visualizations, and an explanation of the methodology.
