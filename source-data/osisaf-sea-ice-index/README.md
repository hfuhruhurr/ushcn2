### Primary Data Source

Northern Hemisphere daily: [ftp](ftp://osisaf.met.no/prod_test/ice/index/v2p2/nh/osisaf_nh_sie_daily.txt)

All sea ice index files: [https](https://osisaf-hl.met.no/archive/osisaf/sea-ice-index/v2p2/)

- "nh" = Northern Hemisphere
- "sh" = Southern Hemisphere
- "sie" = Sea Ice Extent (the more prevelantly used stat)
- "sia" = Sea Ice Area

This is provided via OSI SAF SII Product #OSI-420.  Thorough usage and background info is contained in its [manual](https://osisaf-hl.met.no/sites/osisaf-hl.met.no/files/user_manuals/osisaf_pum_sea-ice-index_v1p2.pdf).

### Helpful

The explanations of the ftp folder structure can be gleaned from OSISAF's [Sea Ice Index page](https://osisaf-hl.met.no/v2p2-sea-ice-index) in the "Data" section.

That same page also provides the data source url, data definitions, visualizations, and an explanation of the methodology.
